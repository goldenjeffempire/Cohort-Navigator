# JOE Forge (Cohort Navigator)

A cohort-based tech-career training platform: courses/lessons, cohorts, assignments, quizzes, coding challenges with an in-browser workspace, scholarships, announcements/notifications, and an AI assistant, with admin tooling for users, challenges, and scholarships.

## Run & Operate

- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run the API server (workflow: "API Server")
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/joe-hub run dev` — run the web app (workflow: "web")
- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from the OpenAPI spec
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run seed` — seed sample courses/lessons/cohorts
- Required env: `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection string (already provisioned)
- Auth: Replit-managed Clerk (`CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` — already provisioned, dev keys)

## Stack

- pnpm workspaces, Node.js 24, TypeScript 5.9
- API: Express 5
- DB: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Validation: Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod`
- API codegen: Orval (from OpenAPI spec)
- Build: esbuild (CJS bundle)

## Where things live

_Populate as you build — short repo map plus pointers to the source-of-truth file for DB schema, API contracts, theme files, etc._

## Architecture decisions

_Populate as you build — non-obvious choices a reader couldn't infer from the code (3-5 bullets)._

## Product

_Describe the high-level user-facing capabilities of this app once they exist._

## User preferences

_Populate as you build — explicit user instructions worth remembering across sessions._

## Gotchas

_Populate as you build — sharp edges, "always run X before Y" rules._
